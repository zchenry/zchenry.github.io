title: Ruby on Rails Server for Rendering JavaScript to HTML
visible: True
---

### Motivation
I want to extract the number of retweets and likes of a tweet using its URL **inside a google spreadsheet**.
At first I thought this can be easily done using the [IMPORTXML](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/3093342?hl=en) function.
However, the response of a tweet URL is not HTML.
It gives JavaScript codes and needs a browser to render it to HTML.
For now and foreseeable future,
it has high probability that google spreadsheets cannot do such a job.
Thus an external server that accomplish this rendering job is needed.

### Method
As I was a [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/) engineer, I decide to develop such a service using the library I am familiar with. And it can be easily deployed on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) for free.

The way it receives the URL is just to pass it as a parameter in an encoded way.
Then the controller can easily receive it using `url=params[:url]`.

After receiving a valid URL, we then need to render the page using libraries such as [selenium-webdriver](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/tree/master/rb).
Then I need to proper set the options for the driver to make sure it works in the Heroku environment.

The code is available on [github](https://github.com/zchenry/js2html).
When I quit developing web applications, it was when Rails 5 was just released.
And now I am using Rails 6.
So there are a lot of new things for me, so the codes are not dry and clean at all.

### Result
I deployed the repository [here](https://js2html.herokuapp.com/).
When there is no URL parameter,
the page will show all URLs of already rendered pages.
For example, when you want to render a page whose URL is `https://twitter.com`,
you can pass the encoded string to the `url` parameter by just accessing [https://js2html.herokuapp.com?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com](https://js2html.herokuapp.com?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com).

So coming back to the initial motivation,
supposing I want to render the page whose URL is in the cell `B2` and
the xpath I want to apply is `//title`,
then using the [ENCODEURL](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/9199778?hl=en&ref_topic=9199554) function and the [CONCATENATE](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/3094123?hl=en) function,
I can get what I want by coding at another cell as `=IMPORTXML(CONCATENATE("https://js2html.herokuapp.com/?url=", ENCODEURL(B2)), "//title")`.
